Question : what is python 
Answer : Python is a programming language that is widely used in many different application domains.
Question : what is physics 
Answer : Physics is the study of the fundamental principles governing the natural world. It covers a wide range of topics, from the smallest particles to the largest structures in the universe.
Question : what is chemistry 
Answer : Chemistry is the study of the properties of matter and the interactions between different types of matter. It is a branch of science that is essential to our understanding of the world around us.
Question : what is nn? 
Answer : There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best neural network architecture for a given problem will vary depending on the specifics of the problem. However, some common architectures for neural networks include fully connected networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks.
Question : what is kinematics 
Answer : Kinematics is the study of motion. It is a branch of physics that deals with the description of motion, without reference to the forces that cause it.
Question : what is the dipole? 
Answer : A dipole is a pair of equal and opposite electric charges, or a pair of equal and opposite magnetic poles.
Question : what is the smallest unit of charge 
Answer : The smallest unit of charge is the electron.

Answer : The position of an object is its location in space.
Question : moving along x-axis is given by x = a + bt2 
Answer : This equation describes motion along the x-axis where a is the initial position, b is the acceleration, and t is the time.
Question : where a = 8.5 m, b = 2.5 m sï¿½2 and t is 
Answer : The position of the object at time t is given by x = 8.5 + 2.5t2.
Question : measured in seconds. What is its velocity at 
Answer : The velocity of the object at time t is given by v = 2.5t.
Question : t = 0 s and t = 2.0 s. What is the average 
Answer : The average velocity of the object over the time interval from t = 0 s to t = 2.0 s is given by v = (2.5t + 2.5(2.0-0))/2.0 = 2.5 m/s.
Question : velocity between t = 2.0 s and t = 4.0 s ?  
Answer : The average velocity of the object over the time interval from t = 2.0 s to t = 4.0 s is given by v = (2.5t + 2.5(4.0-2.0))/2.0 = 3.75 m/s.
Question : Can velocity be negative 
Answer : Yes, velocity can be negative. Velocity is a vector quantity, so it has both magnitude and direction. The direction of velocity can be either positive or negative, depending on the direction of motion.
Question : is kinematics important for JEE 
Answer : Kinematics is one of the important topics for JEE. It is a branch of physics that deals with the description of motion, without reference to the forces that cause it.
Question : Hydrogen gas is not evolved when most of the metals react with nitric acid. why? 
Answer : Hydrogen gas is not evolved when most of the metals react with nitric acid because the metals are not strong enough to reduce the nitric acid to nitrogen gas.
Question : where is africa 
Answer : Africa is a continent located in the eastern hemisphere.
Question : what is land 
Answer : Land is a natural feature of the earth's surface that is composed of solid rock, soil, and vegetation.
Question : what is my friend's name 
Answer : I'm sorry, but I cannot answer that question.
Question : what is my friend's name 
Answer : I'm sorry, but I cannot answer that question.
Question : what is my friend's name 
Answer : I'm sorry, but I cannot answer that question.
Question : what is my friends name 
Answer : I'm sorry, but I cannot answer that question.
Question : what is my friend's name 
Answer : I'm sorry, but I cannot answer that question.
Question : I asked what is my friends name did not reply anything 
Answer : I'm sorry, but I cannot answer that question.
Question 01
Approximately what is the line #include <stdio.h> at the top of a C source
file for?
Answer:
In the case of our first few programs, it lets the compiler know some important information about
the library function, printf. It also lets the compiler know similar information about other
functions in the ``Standard I/O library,'' some of which we'll be learning about later. (It also
provides a few I/O-related definitions which we'll be using later.) We'll learn more about the
#include directive when we cover the C Preprocessor in a few weeks.
Question 02
What are some uses for comments?
Answer:
Describing what a particular variable is for, describing what a function is for and how it works,
documenting the name, version number, purpose, and programmer of an entire program,
explaining any tricky or hard-to-understand part about a program, ...
Question 03
Why is indentation important? How carefully does the compiler pay attention to
it?
Answer:
Indentation is important to show the logical structure of source code, in particular, to show which
parts--the ``bodies`` of loops, if/else statements, and other control flow constructs--are
subsidiary to which other parts.
Indentation is not specially observed by the compiler; it treats all ``white space'' the same. Code
which is improperly indented will give a human reader a mistaken impression of the structure of
the code, an impression potentially completely different from the compilers. Therefore, it's
important that the punctuation which describes the block structure of code to the compiler
matches the indentation.
Question 04
What are the largest and smallest values that can be reliably stored in a variable
of type int?
Question : Approximately what is the line #include <stdio.h> at the top of a C source file for
